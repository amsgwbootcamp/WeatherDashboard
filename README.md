There is a button that will clear local storage.  When you click the button, the next time you click the reload button, no new city will loaded and the screen will reset.  If you click the reload button for the browser, the information will still be displayed for the city that was last displayed.  

On the left side, when you enter a city and click the search button, the information will appear on the right.  The city that was displayed will be seen in a list underneath the input box.  You will be able to click on any of the city names and the information will be redisplayed on the right.    

The top of the right side, you will see the city, date and time displayed.  Underneath that, the temperature, an icon representation, humidity, wind speed and the uv index which is color coded will be displayed to the user.  Red is very bad, yellow is cautionary and green is fine.  At the bottom of the right side, you will see a five day forecast which will display the date, an icon representation, the temperature and the humidity which is based on the forecast for noon of each day displayed.
